# Hanoi
Solves a Tower of Hanoi. Prints solution on the console. The solution will dictate what every movement should be to ensure the minimum number of moves are being used.

Usage requires 1 or more rings. The more rings you use, the longer it takes. I would recommend reading about the Tower of Hanoi before using this program.

## Compiling and Using
To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac Hanoi.java
```

Run the compiled classes with the command:
```
$ java Hanoi
```
