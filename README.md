# Hanoi
Solves a Tower of Hanoi. Prints solution on the console. The solution will dictate what every movement should be to ensure the minimum number of moves are being used.

User will input the (integer)number of rings used. A '0' will print out a relevant response. Any input that is greater than 0 will show all the steps needed to solve the tower quickly. The more rings you use, the longer it takes. Other inputs will result in the program asking the user to enter a different number or exit the program.

I would recommend reading about the Tower of Hanoi before using this program.

## Compiling and Using
